# ü§ñ JARVIS - Voice Controlled Personal Assistant

> "Hello, I'm JARVIS. How can I help you today?"  
Welcome to my Python-based virtual assistant project inspired by Tony Stark‚Äôs JARVIS! Built from scratch using Python, NLP, and voice recognition libraries, this assistant can interact with you via voice commands, manage tasks, open applications, and provide intelligent responses.
